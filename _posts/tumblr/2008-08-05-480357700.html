Agora o PHPUnit tem suporte para Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) e criação de histórias (Stories). Além de Test-Driven Development (TDD) agora BDD no PHPUnit. <a title="Support for BDD and Stories in PHPUnit 3.3" href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/738-Support-for-BDD-and-Stories-in-PHPUnit-3.3.html" target="_blank"></a>



<a title="Support for BDD and Stories in PHPUnit 3.3" href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/738-Support-for-BDD-and-Stories-in-PHPUnit-3.3.html" target="_blank">Nesse artigo</a> do Sebastian Bergmann, ele demonstra como utilizar BDD no PHPUnit descrevendo uma partida de boliche. O que eu achei legal foi o formato de saída:
