<p>Last week we had our first CouchDB webcast with O’Reilly, and it went really well!  Thanks to all that attended, about 185 or so.  Everyone was really active on the chat and the CouchDB experts were great at answering questions from those less familiar with CouchDB.  Hope everyone enjoyed it as much as we did!<br/><br/>Our next webcast is “CouchApp Evently Guided Hack w/ CouchDB” on May 20th.  Please <a title="register" href="http://intranet.oreillynet.com/~andstone/webcasts/couchapp_webcast/couchapp-webcast_prg.html" target="_blank">register</a> now for this free webinar.</p>
